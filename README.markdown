Greyhound Project
=================


Greyhound is a tiny ORM-ish for FreePascal
------------------------------------------

* It will help you with a thin layer to read data from a DBMS, but don't trying to simulate a pure object model.
* It use SQL as query language and don't try to manage complex objects or "entities".
* It does not try to create a complex abstraction for objects vs tables.
* It has support for relationship between tables using "links".
* It was inspired in ActiveRecord pattern but have dynamic columns, not "attributes".
* It allows developers to have greater control of SQL rather than relying on the framework to generate it automatically.
* It has easy transaction support.
* It has the ability to add support for other databases libraries like SQLdb, ZEOS or whatever you want.
* It is fast, clean and simple to use.


What FPC version it will need?
------------------------------

Greyhound compiles with FPC 2.6.0 (better with 2.6.1 or above)
