Features

Database module

- Use one simple interface, but you can choice any Lib (aka Broker) to connect in a DBMS like SQLdb, Zeos or whatever you want;
- CRUD: TghDBTable class to manipulate one table easily (like a ActiveRecord, but you can work with many records at the same object);
- Scripts and Tables: TghDBConnection class to manipulate all tables on the DB;

Many other features will come.
